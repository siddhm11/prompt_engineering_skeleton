CORS configuration.

The app paired allow_origins=["*"] with allow_credentials=True. Starlette
resolves that by reflecting whichever Origin asked, with credentials permitted
— the one combination the CORS spec forbids. Auth here travels in an
Authorization header, never a cookie, so credentialed CORS was never needed.
