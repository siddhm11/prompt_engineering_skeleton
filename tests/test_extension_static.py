"""
Static checks over the extension source.

These exist because of a bug that no amount of Python testing could have found
and that a 64-agent code audit also missed: showSetupRequiredModal() built its
modal, inserted it, and wired up its buttons — but never added the `pm-visible`
class that .pm-modal-overlay needs to become opaque. A new user with no account
and no API key typed a prompt, pressed Enhance, and got nothing at all. No
modal, no toast, no console error. It was found by clicking the button on a
real page.

The checks are deliberately crude text analysis. They cannot verify behaviour,
but they catch the specific shape of "a modal that is built and never shown",
which is cheap insurance for a file with seven of them.
