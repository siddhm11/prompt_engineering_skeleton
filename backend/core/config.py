    Add Qdrant Cloud's REST port when it is missing.

    Qdrant Cloud serves REST on :6333, but the console shows a bare hostname, so
    it is natural to paste it without one. The resulting failure is silent and
    deeply misleading: the client constructs fine and reports connected, then
    every operation fails with "connection reset by peer" because 443 is not the
    API port. Those errors are caught and turned into empty results, so the
    saved-prompt library appears to save correctly and simply never matches
    anything — which is exactly how it behaved in production.

    Narrow on purpose: only a *.cloud.qdrant.io host with no port and no path is
    rewritten, so a deliberate proxy on another port is left alone.
