# Chrome blocks requests from a public origin (chatgpt.com, claude.ai) to a
# loopback address unless the server explicitly opts in on the preflight. That
# is exactly the shape of "extension running on a real site, talking to a
# backend on this laptop", so without this a local backend is unreachable from
# the content script and the failure looks like a generic network error.
